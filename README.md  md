# Invoice PDF Generator (FastAPI + Celery + Headless Chrome)

Overview
- FastAPI backend exposes endpoints to create invoices and to download generated PDFs.
- Celery worker renders HTML (Jinja2) to PDF via a separate headless Chrome container.
- Redis is used as the Celery broker and for short-lived signed download tokens.
- Postgres (docker-compose) is used for storage (SQLModel).
- Local development uses docker-compose; generated PDFs are stored in a shared volume.

Quick start (local)
1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and adjust values (JWT_SECRET, STRIPE keys if using Stripe).
2. Build and start:
   docker-compose up --build

3. Sign up, create templates, create invoices, and download PDFs using the API (see endpoints in README and code).

Structure
- web/: FastAPI app and web Dockerfile
- worker/: Celery worker and worker Dockerfile + templates
- web/ui/: Minimal React UI scaffold for template management
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions workflow to build images and run tests

Security note
- This scaffold includes `.env.sample` only. Do not commit secrets. Replace JWT_SECRET and Stripe keys before production.
